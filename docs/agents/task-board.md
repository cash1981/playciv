# Task board

Who is working on what. **Claim before you edit; release when you stop.** Edit
only your own block. If a live claim lists a path you need, pick other work or
ask the orchestrator to sequence the tasks. Delete your block, with the brief,
in the branch's last commit.

Status: `claimed` · `in progress` · `in review` · `blocked`.
